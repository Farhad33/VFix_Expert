## Considerations
**1. Q: What is your product pitch?**
  * Start with a problem statement and follow up with a solution.
  * Focus on engaging your audience with a relatable need.
 
A: Unfortunately people will break their phone or laptop from time to time. They canâ€™t always conveniently get out to Best Buy, etc. VFix is here to help. 

**2. Q: Who are the key stakeholders for this app?**
  * Who will be using this?
  * What will they be using this for?
  
A: For VFix_Expert we are going to allow VFix technicians access to their client/job info on demand. 

**3. Q: What are the core flows?**
  * What are the key functions?
  * What screens will each user see?
  

A: Technician logs into the app. They are then brought to a Calendar or Table View of their current jobs. They can then click on the job and view the detais associated with it.

**4. Q: What will your final demo look like?**
  * Describe the flow of your final demo
  
A: We can showcase what it's like to get a request that VFix_Client had just previously created.

**5. Q: What mobile features do you leverage?**
    * Leverage at least two mobile-oriented features (i.e. maps and camera)
    
A: We could definitely use maps to provide direction to the client/job.

**6. Q: What are your technical concerns?**
  * What technical features do you need help or resources for?
  
A: Not sure yet.

## API Endpoints
Still waiting for our custom API. Will update.
